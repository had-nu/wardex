### 🐛 Bugs

| ID | Priority | Effort | Target | Impact | Gap / Problem | Dev Adoption Impact | Tags |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| **G-01** | ⚡ Critical | XS | v1.1.1 | ●●●●● | **`--expires 30d` silently fails** — `time.ParseDuration()` only accepts h/m/s/ns. Passing `--expires 30d` (`cli.go:91`) returns a parse error and kills the accept request mid-flow. | Every CI integration using the documented `--expires 14d`/`--expires 30d` syntax fails. The README advertises this syntax explicitly. Breaks Scenario 04 of the PoC for any user who follows the docs literally. | CI/CD · Accept · DX |
| **G-02** | ⚡ Critical | XS | v1.1.1 | ●●●●● | **`--config` flag ignored by `wardex accept` subcommands** — `config.Load('./wardex-config.yaml')` hardcoded at `cli.go:55` in all `accept` subcommands, ignoring the root `--config` flag. | Monorepos and CI pipelines that store config outside CWD produce cryptic 'failed to load config' errors or silently use empty defaults — breaking HMAC secret resolution and making all accept operations fail. | CI/CD · Accept · DX |
| **G-03** | ▲ High | S | v1.1.1 | ●●●● | **`--cve` multi-value silently drops all but first CVE** — flag declared as StringSlice, only `reqCVEs[0]` stored (`cli.go:104`). No error, no warning. | A security lead accepting 3 CVEs in a batch believes all 3 are covered. Only 1 is. The gate re-runs and still BLOCKs. Audit trail appears complete but is not. | Accept · Security · GRC |
| **G-04** | ▲ High | XS | v1.1.1 | ●●●● | **Exit code 2 on BLOCK inconsistent with documented exit code 1** — `main.go:220` emits `os.Exit(2)`. Exit code 2 in POSIX means "misuse of shell builtins" — semantically wrong. | Any CI script using `if [ $? -eq 1 ]` to detect BLOCK treats the result as an unexpected crash, failing silently and allowing releases that should be blocked. | CI/CD · DX |
| **G-05** | ▸ Medium | XS | v1.1.1 | ●●● | **Banned justification phrases use equality instead of substring match** — `validator.go:40` uses `==` instead of `strings.Contains`. A banned phrase `n/a` only triggers if the entire justification is exactly `n/a`. | Toothless content policy. Users can write "see ticket for details, n/a applies here" and bypass the ban entirely. | Security · GRC · Accept |
| **G-06** | ▾ Low | XS | v1.1.1 | ●●● | **No `--version` flag despite `wardex --version` in README** — cobra root command has no `Version` field set. Running `wardex --version` throws `Error: unknown flag: --version`. | Every user who follows the getting-started guide gets an error on the very first verification command they run. | DX |

### ⚠ Incomplete

| ID | Priority | Effort | Target | Impact | Gap / Problem | Dev Adoption Impact | Tags |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| **G-07** | ▲ High | M | v1.2.0 | ●●●● | **`wardex accept verify-forwarding` not implemented** — `cli.go:245` prints "Implementation pending" and exits 0. The command is registered, appears in `--help`, and is documented. | Security teams relying on this command to confirm SIEM delivery get false assurance. In a compliance audit, the audit trail may not have been forwarded but the command reports success. | SIEM · Accept · GRC |
| **G-08** | ▸ Medium | S | v1.2.0 | ●●● | **`wardex accept list --output json\|csv` not implemented** — flag declared at `cli.go:202`, only table output coded. Passing `--output json` produces the same table regardless. | Blocks automation. Teams that want to programmatically parse the acceptance list (for a dashboard or GRC tool integration) cannot do so. | Accept · SDK · GRC |
| **G-09** | ▸ Medium | M | v1.2.0 | ●●●● | **`warn` decision never produced by release gate** — `model/release.go:45` declares `"block\|allow\|warn"`, gate engine only ever produces `block`/`allow`. No warn threshold configurable. | The `warn` state is the missing middle-ground for risk-tolerant teams who want observability without hard gates. Without it, teams facing too many BLOCKs disable the gate entirely. | Gate · CI/CD · DX |
| **G-10** | ▾ Low | XS | v1.1.1 | ●● | **Roadmap truncated at 10 items in Markdown report** — `markdown.go:79` hard-caps at `count >= 10`. No flag to control the limit. JSON and CSV are unaffected. | Organisations with many partial controls miss findings from the Markdown report used as ISO 27001 audit evidence. | Report · GRC |
| **G-11** | ▸ Medium | XS | v1.2.0 | ●●● | **Snapshot file path not configurable** — `snapshot.go:11` hardcodes `const SnapshotFile = ".wardex_snapshot.json"`. No flag or config option to redirect it. | Monorepo pipelines with multiple wardex invocations in the same working directory corrupt each other's snapshots, undermining ISO 27001 Clause 10.2 delta tracking. | CI/CD · Report |

### ✦ Features

| ID | Priority | Effort | Target | Impact | Gap / Problem | Dev Adoption Impact | Tags |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| **G-12** | ⚡ Critical | M | v1.2.0 | ●●●●● | **No native Grype/SARIF vulnerability input adapter** — `--gate` expects a custom YAML format. Grype outputs JSON/SARIF/table. Users must write a converter script before the gate works at all. | Doubles the integration effort. Every team adopting Wardex must write and maintain a Grype→Wardex converter. This is the #1 friction point for CI adoption. | CI/CD · DX · Integration |
| **G-13** | ▲ High | L | v1.3.0 | ●●●● | **No CycloneDX / SPDX SBOM ingestion** — `pkg/ingestion` only reads control YAML/JSON/CSV; no SBOM format reader. | SBOM-first pipelines (increasingly mandatory under EU Cyber Resilience Act and US EO 14028) cannot use Wardex natively. | SBOM · Compliance · Integration |
| **G-14** | ▲ High | S | v1.2.0 | ●●●●● | **No `warn` threshold — risk band configuration** — `config.Thresholds` struct has a `WarnAbove` field (`config.go`) but it is never wired to the gate. Single risk_appetite threshold only. | Teams in staging environments want observability without hard blocks. Without warn mode, they either lower risk_appetite (too many BLOCKs) or raise it (misses real risks) — driving them to simpler threshold-based tools. | Gate · CI/CD · DX |
| **G-15** | ▲ High | XL | v2.0.0 | ●●●● | **No RBAC / per-team risk appetite configuration** — one `wardex-config.yaml` defines a single risk appetite for all pipelines. No team scoping. | Enterprises with 5+ teams cannot centralise risk governance without duplicating config files. Blocks platform engineering adoption. | Enterprise · GRC · RBAC |
| **G-16** | ▸ Medium | S | v1.2.0 | ●●●● | **wardex-risk-simulator.jsx not shipped as usable web UI** — polished React simulator exists in `test/` but not referenced in README, not served by CLI, not released. | GRC managers and non-developer stakeholders have no way to validate risk parameters interactively. Shipping as `wardex simulate` would dramatically lower the adoption barrier for business audiences. | DX · GRC · UI |
| **G-17** | ▸ Medium | L | v1.3.0 | ●●● | **No VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) support** — model has no VEX struct; ingestion has no VEX reader. Cannot consume upstream VEX assertions to auto-suppress false positives. | Container-heavy teams using CycloneDX VEX must manually handle suppressed CVEs in Wardex gate format. Misaligns with the emerging SBOM compliance ecosystem (EU CRA, CISA). | SBOM · Compliance · Integration |
| **G-18** | ▸ Medium | S | v1.2.0 | ●●●● | **No godoc API reference for `pkg/` packages** — no doc comments on exported types. Running `go doc github.com/had-nu/wardex/pkg/releasegate` produces sparse output. | Go developers evaluating Wardex as a library cannot quickly understand the API surface. If you can't read the docs in 2 minutes, you move on. | SDK · DX · Documentation |

### ◈ Strategic

| ID | Priority | Effort | Target | Impact | Gap / Problem | Dev Adoption Impact | Tags |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| **G-19** | ▲ High | L | v1.3.0 | ●●●● | **No SOC 2 / NIS2 / DORA framework mapping** — control catalog is ISO 27001-only. European organisations under NIS2 (mandatory since Oct 2024) or financial firms under DORA (Jan 2025) have no native framework. | Limits addressable market to ISO 27001 adopters. Adding NIS2 + SOC 2 TSC would expand to EU critical infrastructure and US SaaS companies — likely 3–4x the potential user base. | Compliance · GRC · Market |
| **G-20** | ▲ High | L | v1.3.0 | ●●●●● | **No external security audit of cryptographic modules** — `pkg/accept/signer` and `pkg/accept/verifier` are bespoke implementations with no third-party penetration test or code audit. | Regulated industries (finance, healthcare) will not adopt a tool without a security audit certificate. Without it, Wardex cannot be presented to an ISO 27001 auditor as a trustworthy GRC tool. | Security · GRC · Enterprise |
| **G-21** | ▸ Medium | S | v1.3.0 | ●●●● | **AGPL-3.0 blocks SaaS embedding without source disclosure** — AGPL requires that any service offering Wardex functionality over a network discloses the modified source. | Dual licensing (AGPL for OSS + commercial licence for SaaS embedding) is standard in this space. Without it, Wardex misses commercial embedding revenue and ISV partner integrations. | Market · Licensing · Enterprise |
| **G-22** | ▸ Medium | XS | v1.1.1 | ●●● | **No changelog / release notes** — no `CHANGELOG.md`, no GitHub Release body. v1.1.0 is titled "The Risk Acceptance Engine" with no content. | Enterprise teams cannot justify upgrades without a changelog. Leading reason OSS projects stagnate at a pinned version forever. | DX · Documentation · Community |

## 2. Developer Adoption Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Adoption Funnel Map — Where Each Gap Strikes

| Funnel Stage | Gaps | Impact Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| **First run** (< 5 min) | G-06 | Running `wardex --version` as the first verification step throws an error. First impression = broken. Affects every new adopter who follows the README or any tutorial. |
| **Getting started** (< 30 min) | G-01, G-02 | Following the PoC: `wardex accept request --expires 30d` crashes (G-01). Running wardex from a subdirectory with `--config` flag silently loads wrong config (G-02). Both hit devs in the first integration attempt. |
| **First CI pipeline** (day 1) | G-04, G-12 | Exit code 2 on BLOCK breaks CI assertions (G-04). No Grype adapter means writing a converter before the gate works at all (G-12). Together, these are the top 2 reasons a developer abandons the integration. |
| **First compliance run** (week 1) | G-10, G-11 | Markdown report shows only 10 roadmap items regardless of actual gap count (G-10). In a monorepo, snapshot files corrupt each other (G-11). GRC teams receive incomplete data. |
| **SDK adoption** (week 2–4) | G-18 | Developers evaluating Wardex as a Go library have no godoc to read. Without documentation, library evaluation stalls immediately. |
| **Long-term retention** (month 2+) | G-07, G-08, G-09, G-03, G-05 | `verify-forwarding` gives false assurance (G-07). Batch CVE acceptance silently drops CVEs (G-03). Banned phrases don't trigger (G-05). No warn mode causes teams to disable the gate entirely rather than tune it (G-09). These erode trust over time. |
| **Enterprise adoption** (month 3+) | G-15, G-19, G-20, G-21 | No RBAC blocks multi-team rollout (G-15). No NIS2/SOC2 mapping limits market (G-19). No security audit prevents regulated-industry adoption (G-20). AGPL blocks SaaS embedding (G-21). |

### 2.2 Impact Score by Category

| Category | Avg Score | Count | Strategic Rationale |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| 🐛 Bug | 4.0/5 | 6 (27%) | Bugs score highest because they hit developers who are already motivated to adopt. Bug fixes have the highest return on engineering investment for adoption metrics. |
| ⚠ Incomplete | 3.2/5 | 5 (23%) | Incomplete features create a "documentation lies" effect — the user invests time learning a feature, then discovers it doesn't work. Erodes trust more than a missing feature. |
| ✦ Feature | 4.1/5 | 7 (32%) | G-12 (Grype adapter) and G-14 (warn mode) score 5/5 individually. Feature gaps decide whether Wardex fits an existing toolchain without extra glue code. |
| ◈ Strategic | 4.0/5 | 4 (18%) | Strategic gaps don't block individual adoption but prevent organisational adoption at scale. G-20 (security audit) is the single most impactful item for regulated industries. |

## 3. Quick Wins — Sprint Plan

**Definition:** Effort XS (< 1 day) or S (1–3 days) AND adoption impact ≥ 4/5, OR Critical/High priority bugs.

All quick wins below can be shipped in a **single 5-day sprint** and collectively remove the top adoption friction barriers for developers trying Wardex for the first time.

### 3.1 Quick Win Summary — Wardex v1.1.1 Sprint

| ID | Gap | Effort | Impact | Fix Description | Expected Outcome | File(s) |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| G-01 | `--expires 30d` silently fails | XS | ●●●●● | Parse `d` suffix manually before calling `time.ParseDuration`. Map `30d` → `30 × 24 × time.Hour`. Add unit test for d/h/m formats. | `--expires 14d` / `--expires 30d` work as documented. Scenario 04 PoC passes for all users. | `accept/cli/cli.go:91` |
| G-02 | `--config` ignored by accept subcommands | XS | ●●●●● | Thread root `--config` flag value down to accept subcommands via cobra annotations or package-level var set in `init()`. | CI pipelines with config in non-CWD locations work correctly. HMAC secret resolution is reliable. | `accept/cli/cli.go:55` |
| G-03 | Multi-CVE acceptance drops all but first | S | ●●●● | Iterate `reqCVEs` slice and create one `Acceptance` record per CVE, appending all to store. Update audit log to record all CVEIDs. | Batch acceptance operations are reliable. Audit trail accurately reflects all covered CVEs. | `accept/cli/cli.go:104` |
| G-04 | Exit code 2 on BLOCK (should be 1) | XS | ●●●● | Change `os.Exit(2)` → `os.Exit(1)` on gate BLOCK. Reserve exit 2 for internal errors. Update PoC assertions and README exit code table. | All CI patterns using `if [ $? -eq 1 ]` detect BLOCK correctly. Standard bash `&&`/`\|\|` chaining works. | `main.go:220` |
| G-05 | Banned phrases use equality not substring | XS | ●●● | Replace `lowerJustification == strings.ToLower(phrase)` with `strings.Contains(lowerJustification, strings.ToLower(phrase))`. | Content policy actually works. Lazy justifications containing banned phrases are caught. | `accept/validator/validator.go:40` |
| G-06 | No `--version` flag | XS | ●●● | Set `rootCmd.Version = version` in `main.go`. Define build-time ldflags var: `-ldflags '-X main.version=v1.1.1'`. | `wardex --version` works on first run. Removes error on the very first command in the getting-started flow. | `main.go` |
| G-08 | `accept list --output json\|csv` not implemented | S | ●●● | Add `json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).Encode(acceptances)` and CSV writer branches in `listCmd.Run`, gated on `listOutput` flag. | Acceptance lists are parseable programmatically. Enables dashboard and GRC tool integrations. | `accept/cli/cli.go:187` |
| G-10 | Roadmap hard-capped at 10 items | XS | ●● | Add `--roadmap-limit` flag (default 10, 0 = unlimited). Wire to `count >= N` break in `generateMarkdown`. | Organisations with many gaps receive complete roadmap data in Markdown reports used as audit evidence. | `report/markdown.go:79` |
| G-12 | No Grype input adapter | M | ●●●●● | Add `wardex convert grype <grype-json>` subcommand reading Grype JSON output and emitting Wardex gate YAML. ~40-line transformer. | Grype users integrate in 1 command. Eliminates the #1 integration friction point entirely. | `new: cmd/convert/grype.go` |
| G-14 | No `warn` threshold / risk band | S | ●●●●● | Add `warn_above` field to `ReleaseGate` config struct. In `gate.go`, produce `"warn"` decision when `warn_above < risk ≤ risk_appetite`. Wire to exit code 0 with warning output. | Teams in staging get observability without hard blocks. Reduces gate disablement incidents dramatically. | `config/config.go`, `releasegate/gate.go` |
| G-16 | Risk simulator not shipped | S | ●●●● | Add `wardex simulate` subcommand serving the JSX as a self-contained HTML file via `go:embed`. No external server needed. | GRC managers and non-developer stakeholders can interactively validate risk parameters without terminal access. | `main.go`, `test/wardex-risk-simulator.jsx` |
| G-18 | No godoc API reference | S | ●●●● | Add godoc comments to all exported types and functions in `pkg/releasegate`, `pkg/model`, `pkg/ingestion`. Run `go doc` to verify. Push to trigger pkg.go.dev indexing. | Go developers evaluating Wardex as a library can read the API in 2 minutes. SDK adoption rate increases. | `pkg/**/*.go` |
| G-22 | No changelog / release notes | XS | ●●● | Create `CHANGELOG.md` with Keep a Changelog format. Add changelog body to v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 GitHub Releases. | Enterprise teams can assess upgrade risk and justify upgrades to their security teams. | `CHANGELOG.md` |

### 3.2 Sprint Schedule — 5 Days

| Day | Gaps | Est. Hours | Work Items |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Day 1 AM** — Bug cluster 1 | G-01, G-04, G-05, G-06 | ~4h | Fix `--expires 30d` duration parser · Fix exit code 2→1 · Fix banned phrase substring check · Add `--version` with ldflags. All XS, same file cluster (`cli.go` + `main.go`). |
| **Day 1 PM** — Bug cluster 2 | G-02, G-03 | ~4h | Thread `--config` flag to accept subcommands · Fix multi-CVE acceptance to iterate full `reqCVEs` slice. Requires cobra context threading. |
| **Day 2** — Incomplete features | G-08, G-10, G-14 | ~6h | Add JSON/CSV output to `wardex accept list` · Remove 10-item roadmap hard cap with `--roadmap-limit` flag · Wire `warn_above` threshold to gate and exit code. |
| **Day 3** — Integration | G-12 | ~4h | Grype JSON → Wardex gate YAML converter (`wardex convert grype`). Read Grype JSON schema, map `CVEID`/`CvssMetrics`/`EpssProbability`/`Reachability` → `model.Vulnerability` YAML. Add integration test. |
| **Day 4** — DX | G-16, G-18, G-22 | ~5h | Embed risk simulator as `wardex simulate` · Write godoc for all `pkg/` exported symbols · Create `CHANGELOG.md` and fill v1.1.0 + v1.1.1 release notes. |
| **Day 5** — QA + Release | — | ~3h | Run full test suite + fuzz tests · Update README exit code table · Tag v1.1.1 · Write GitHub Release notes · Publish to pkg.go.dev. |

**Total estimated effort: ~26 hours**

### 3.3 Expected Adoption Uplift

If the 5-day sprint ships as v1.1.1, the following friction points are eliminated across all funnel stages:

- **First-run experience:** `wardex --version` works. No error on first command. (G-06)
- **Getting-started docs become accurate:** `--expires 30d` works, `--config` is respected everywhere. (G-01, G-02)
- **CI pipelines become reliable:** exit code 1 on BLOCK works with all standard CI patterns. (G-04)
- **Grype users integrate in 1 command:** `wardex convert grype grype-output.json > gate.yaml`. (G-12)
- **GRC trustworthiness:** banned phrases actually trigger, multi-CVE acceptance works, warn mode available. (G-03, G-05, G-14)
- **SDK adopters can read the API:** godoc published on pkg.go.dev. (G-18)

Combined, these changes address all adoption funnel stages from "first run" through "first CI pipeline" — the three stages with the highest abandonment rate. Conservative estimate: a well-executed v1.1.1 sprint would **increase GitHub star acquisition rate by 3–5x** and reduce "I tried it but gave up" reports to near-zero for the documented use cases.
