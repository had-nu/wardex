# scenario-04-risk-acceptance.yaml
# Expected initial decision: BLOCK
# After wardex accept request → pipeline resumes with auditable exception record
#
# This scenario simulates a real operational decision:
#   A critical dependency vulnerability (log4j-class) has no patch available yet.
#   The security lead formally accepts the risk for 14 days while the vendor works
#   on a fix. No compensating controls are active yet — the WAF virtual patch
#   will be deployed after the exception is registered.
#
# Composite = CVSS(9.1) × EPSS(0.84) × criticality(0.85) × exposure(1.0) ≈ 6.50
# Since 6.50 > 6.0 (appetite) → BLOCK
#
# The GitHub Actions job will:
#   1. Run the gate      → BLOCK (exit 1)
#   2. Register exception via `wardex accept request`
#   3. Re-run the gate   → ALLOW (exit 0, exception honoured)
#   4. Verify integrity  via `wardex accept verify`
