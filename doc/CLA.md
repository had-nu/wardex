# Wardex — Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.1 — Effective: 1 March 2026**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wardex (`github.com/had-nu/wardex`).

To protect both contributors and users of Wardex, and to enable Wardex to be offered
under multiple licences including commercial licences, all contributors must sign this
Contributor Licence Agreement ("CLA") before their Pull Requests can be merged.

**You do not need to sign this CLA to use Wardex**, whether under AGPL-3.0 or a
commercial licence. This CLA applies only to those who submit code contributions.

## Why a CLA Is Required — And Why It Is a Licence Grant, Not a Copyright Assignment

Wardex is dual-licensed: free under AGPL-3.0 for open-source and internal use,
and commercially licensed for proprietary SaaS embedding. For this dual-licence model
to work, the Project Owner must be able to sublicence all code in the repository —
including external contributions — under commercial terms without seeking individual
permission for each use.

This CLA achieves that by granting the Project Owner a broad copyright licence,
including the right to sublicence commercially.

**Why a licence grant rather than copyright assignment?**

Contributors in EU member states hold inalienable moral rights (droits moraux /
direitos morais de autor) under the Berne Convention, the EU Copyright Directive
(2001/29/EC), and national law (e.g., Código do Direito de Autor e dos Direitos
Conexos, approved by Decreto-Lei n.º 63/85, as amended in Portugal). These moral
rights — including the right of attribution and the right to object to derogatory
treatment of the work — cannot be fully transferred by assignment under the law of
most EU member states. A copyright assignment CLA would therefore be partially
unenforceable for EU contributors.

This CLA instead uses a broad, irrevocable copyright licence with sublicensing
rights, which achieves the same practical effect for dual-licensing purposes while
respecting contributors' inalienable moral rights.

## The Agreement

By signing this CLA, you ("Contributor") agree to the following terms. In consideration
of the opportunity to contribute to Wardex and the mutual benefits derived therefrom —
including the ability to have your contribution included in a widely-used open-source
project, which constitutes good and valuable consideration acknowledged by both parties —
Contributor agrees as follows:

### 1. Definitions

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including but not limited to
source code, documentation, configuration files, test cases, and other materials,
submitted by Contributor to the Wardex project repository via a Pull Request,
issue attachment, email, or any other method of delivery.

**"Project Owner"** means André Gustavo Leão de Melo Ataíde (GitHub: had-nu), the
primary copyright holder and maintainer of Wardex.

**"Submit"** means any form of communication sent to the Project Owner or the
repository, including but not limited to communication via electronic mailing lists,
source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

### 2. Copyright Licence Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, Contributor hereby grants to the
Project Owner a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright licence** to:

  (a) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicence, and distribute the Contribution and such derivative works in
      source or object form, under any licence terms chosen by the Project Owner,
      including commercial licence terms;

  (b) include the Contribution in dual-licensed distributions of Wardex offered
      under both AGPL-3.0 and a commercial licence, without seeking further
      permission from Contributor; and

  (c) transfer or sublicence these rights to any successor maintainer of the
      Wardex project or to any entity that acquires the Wardex project in whole
      or in part.

**Moral Rights.** Contributor retains all moral rights (direitos morais / droits moraux)
in the Contribution to the extent they are inalienable under applicable law. These include
the right of attribution — the Project Owner will not remove Contributor's name from
the version control history, even if individual attribution in source file headers is
not maintained. Contributor agrees not to exercise any moral rights in a manner that
would prevent the Project Owner from exercising the copyright licence granted in this
Section 2 in good faith, including exercising any right to modify or integrate the
Contribution into Wardex in ways that are technically or commercially reasonable.

### 3. Patent Licence Grant

Contributor hereby grants to the Project Owner and to all recipients of software
distributed by the Project Owner a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable patent licence** to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and works that incorporate the
Contribution, where such licence applies only to those patent claims owned or controlled
by Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the Contribution alone or by
combination of the Contribution with Wardex at the time of submission.

### 4. Contributor Representations and Warranties

Contributor represents and warrants that:

  (a) **Legal authority.** Contributor has the full legal right to enter into this
      CLA and to grant the licences set forth herein.

  (b) **Original creation.** The Contribution is Contributor's original creation, or
      Contributor has sufficient rights to submit it under this CLA. If the Contribution
      includes or is based on work created by a third party, Contributor discloses this
      in the Pull Request and identifies the applicable licence.

  (c) **Employer permission.** If Contributor is employed and the Contribution relates
      to Contributor's employment or was created using employer resources, Contributor
      has obtained all necessary employer authorisations, or the employer has signed
      a separate CLA with the Project Owner.

  (d) **No conflicting obligations.** Contributor is not subject to any agreement or
      obligation — including a non-compete, employment agreement, or independent
      contractor agreement — that conflicts with the rights granted in this CLA.

  (e) **Legal compliance.** The Contribution does not, to Contributor's knowledge,
      infringe any third party's intellectual property rights, violate any applicable
      law, or incorporate code subject to a licence that is incompatible with AGPL-3.0
      or that would restrict the Project Owner's ability to sublicence commercially.

  (f) **Notification of changes.** Contributor shall notify the Project Owner promptly
      if Contributor becomes aware that any representation in this Section 4 was or
      becomes inaccurate.

### 5. No Obligation to Include

This CLA does not obligate the Project Owner to include, use, or maintain the
Contribution in Wardex, or to use the Contribution in any particular way.

### 6. No Additional Compensation

Contributor acknowledges that no compensation is payable in connection with this CLA
or for any Contribution. The consideration for this CLA is the opportunity to
contribute to an open-source project and the benefits described in the preamble.

### 7. CLA Version and Future Contributions

This CLA (Version 1.1) applies to all Contributions submitted by Contributor from
the date of signing until the Project Owner publishes a new CLA version. If a new
version is published, Contributor will be notified via the CLA Assistant bot on any
subsequent Pull Request. Continued contribution after that notification constitutes
acceptance of the new version. Contributions submitted before a new version takes
effect remain governed by the version in effect at the time of submission.

### 8. Revocability

The licence grant in Section 2 is irrevocable for Contributions already submitted.
Contributor may withdraw from future contributions at any time by providing written
notice to the Project Owner, but this does not affect the irrevocability of licences
granted for Contributions already submitted and merged.

### 9. Data Protection (GDPR Notice)

To administer this CLA, the Project Owner and the CLA Assistant service process the
following Personal Data (as defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, "GDPR"): Contributor's
GitHub username, display name, email address associated with the GitHub account, and the
date and content of the CLA signature (as recorded in `signatures/version1/cla.json`).

  (a) **Legal basis for processing:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) —
      specifically, the legitimate interest of the Project Owner in maintaining a
      record of CLA signatures to support dual-licensing rights and to comply with
      any future legal or audit obligations.

  (b) **Retention:** Signature records are retained for the lifetime of the Wardex
      project and for a minimum of ten (10) years after the last Contribution by
      the Contributor, to the extent necessary for the Project Owner to demonstrate
      the existence of valid licence grants.

  (c) **Processor:** CLA Assistant (cla-assistant.io), operated by SAP SE, acts as a
      data processor for signature storage under a Data Processing Agreement with the
      Project Owner.

  (d) **Data subject rights:** Contributor has the right to access, rectify, and port
      their Personal Data. Contributor also has the right to object to processing on
      grounds of their particular situation, subject to the Project Owner's legitimate
      interests. Requests should be directed to: andre_ataide@proton.me. Note that
      erasure of CLA signature records may prevent future contributions from being
      accepted, as signature history would be incomplete.

  (e) **Transfers:** Signature data may be stored on servers outside the EEA if the
      CLA Assistant service infrastructure is located outside the EU/EEA. Any such
      transfer is subject to the appropriate safeguards under Chapter V GDPR.

### 10. Governing Law

This CLA is governed by the substantive law of Portugal, excluding Portugal's
private international law conflict-of-law rules. The application of this CLA is
further subject to mandatory provisions of EU law applicable to its subject matter —
including the GDPR and the applicable national implementation of the EU Copyright
Directive (2001/29/EC) — which shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this CLA that cannot be resolved by
direct negotiation within thirty (30) days of written notice shall be submitted to
binding arbitration under the Rules of the Centro de Arbitragem Comercial da Câmara
de Comércio e Indústria Portuguesa (CAC), seated in Lisbon, Portugal, conducted in
English or Portuguese by a sole arbitrator. The award shall be final and enforceable
under the New York Convention (1958).
