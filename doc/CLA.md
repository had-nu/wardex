# Wardex — Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA)

**Version 1.0**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wardex (`github.com/had-nu/wardex`).

To protect both contributors and users of Wardex, and to enable Wardex to be offered
under multiple licences (including commercial licences for proprietary embedding),
all contributors must sign this Contributor Licence Agreement before their Pull Requests
can be merged.

**You do not need to sign this CLA to use Wardex**, whether under AGPL-3.0 or a
commercial licence.

---

## Why a CLA is Required

Wardex is dual-licensed: free under AGPL-3.0 for open-source use, and commercially
licensed for proprietary embedding. For this model to work legally, the project maintainer
must be able to grant commercial licences that cover all code in the repository — including
contributions from external developers.

Without a CLA, each contributor retains copyright over their contribution and
could prevent the project maintainer from offering commercial licences that include that code.

## How to Sign

Signing is handled automatically via [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io).
When you open a Pull Request, a bot will comment with a sign-in link.
Sign in with your GitHub account, read the agreement below, and confirm.
The CI check will then pass and your PR can be reviewed.

      permission to make the Contribution;

  (d) the Contribution does not violate any applicable law or any third party's
      intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights.

### 5. No Obligation

or to use the Contribution in any particular way.
